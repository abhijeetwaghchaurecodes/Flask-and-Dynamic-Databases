A library of python mainly used to create web applications, 

in this, we've set up our virtual environment in VS Code Editor and installed the Flask Dependancies 

ROUTE - url of any website changes when we access different elements of a website

HERE WE CREATED AND RUN- THE FLASK WEB SERVER 

code - 
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)             ------[creates the root directory to be hosted]

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return "hello"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host = '0.0.0.0', debug=True)
